    "#Multithreading is the ability of a program or an operating system to enable more than one user at a time without requiring multiple copies of the program running on the computer. Multithreading can also handle various requests from the same user. Each user request for a program or system service is tracked as a thread with a separate identity. As programs work on behalf of the initial thread request and are interrupted by other demands, the work status of the initial request is tracked until the work is completed. In this context, a user can also be another program.\n",
